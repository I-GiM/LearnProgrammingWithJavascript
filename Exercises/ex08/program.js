// Write a function isPrime that takes an integer number and returns a boolean saying if the number is prime.
// Assume a prime number is a positive integer that is perfectly divisible only by one and by itself.
// You should write your code in place of the comment below that reads // place your code here
// The program below should produce the following output:
// Is 27 prime? false
// Is 8831 prime? true
