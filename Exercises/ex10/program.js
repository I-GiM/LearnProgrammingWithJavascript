// Write a function fibonacci that takes a positive integer number n and writes the first n numbers in a Fibonacci sequence.
// Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is 
// the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1 
// The program below should produce the following output:
// F4 = 0, 1, 1, 2
// F9 = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
// 
// PS. Write it as a recursive function

program();

function program() {
    console.log("F4 = " + fibonacci(4));
    console.log("F9 = " + fibonacci(9));
}

function factorial(n) {
// place your code here
