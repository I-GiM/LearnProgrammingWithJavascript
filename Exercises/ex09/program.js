// Write a function factorial that takes a positive integer number and returns its factorial.
// The factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. 
// For example, 5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120
// You should write your code in place of the comment below that reads // place your code here
// The program below should produce the following output:
// 5! = 120
//
// hint: there are many ways to solve this, by try researching and writing it as a "recursive function"

program();

function program() {
    console.log("5! = " + factorial(5));
}

function factorial(n) {
// place your code here
}
