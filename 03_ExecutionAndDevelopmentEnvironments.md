# Execution and Development Environments

---

We have seen that Javascript is the language of the web, and it can run on every major modern browser. In addition to that, depending
on the framework used, it can run on Windows, Max OS/X, Linux, tablets, smartphones and probably a bunch of additional places. 

In order to keep things simple, we will limit the number of execution environments. We will use an environment that allows Javascript to
run as a server on Windows, Macs, and Linux, but since one of the big strenghts of Javascript is running on browsers, we will have a taste
of that too.
