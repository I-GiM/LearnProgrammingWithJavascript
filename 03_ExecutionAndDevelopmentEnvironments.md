# Execution and Development Environments

---

We have seen that Javascript is the language of the web, and it can run on every major modern browser. In addition to that, depending
on the framework used, it can run on Windows, Mac OS/X, Linux, tablets, smartphones and probably a bunch of other places too. 

In order to keep things simple, we will limit the number of execution environments. We will use an environment that allows Javascript to
run as a server (or desktop application) on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but since one of the big strenghts of Javascript is running on
browsers, we will also have a taste of that too.

To run Javascript in a "standalone application" context, we will use Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, designed to build network
applications, like web server ones. It is a very popular open source platform that can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. So popular, i
n fact, that on the Stackoverflow Developer Survey of 2018, Node.js is the most popular option in the "Framework, Library, or Tool" 
category.

To run Javascript on a web browser, we will use a web site that is a combination of development and execution environment: Plunker. Plunker bla

## Node.js

To run Node.js you have to first download and install it. You can obtain the most recent version for your computer at the official website [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Use all the defaults for the installation.
