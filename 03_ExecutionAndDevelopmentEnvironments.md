# Execution and Development Environments

---

We have seen that Javascript is the language of the web, and it can run on every major modern browser. In addition to that, depending
on the framework used, it can run on Windows, Mac OS/X, Linux, tablets, smartphones and probably a bunch of other places too. 

In order to keep things simple, we will limit the number of execution environments. We will use an environment that allows Javascript to
run as a server (or desktop application) on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but since one of the big strenghts of Javascript is running on
browsers, we will also have a taste of that too.

To run Javascript in a "standalone application" context, we will use Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, designed to build network
applications, like web server ones. It is a very popular open source platform that can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. So popular, i
n fact, that on the Stackoverflow Developer Survey of 2018, Node.js is the most popular option in the "Framework, Library, or Tool" 
category.

To run Javascript on a web browser, we will use a web site that is a combination of development and execution environment: Plunker. On Plunker you can create your own web projects, or "_plunks_", containing your Javascript code that will run on browsers, together with whatever other files are needed for that, like _HTML_ and _CSS_ files. Feel free to use Plunker from any browser you want, but I will only provide instructions for the most common one, Google Chrome. If you use other browser, like Firefox, Edge, or Safari, you will have  to find the equivalent commands on your own, but hey, this can be a good thing: you learn to program and also increase your web search and problem solving skills, all at once.

## Node.js

To run Node.js you have to first download it and install it. You can obtain the most recent version for your computer at the official website [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Use all the defaults for the installation. If you are running on Linux you may need to do some research on the Internet about how to get Node properly installed, but if that is the case, you are certainly already used to doing that.

You can verify that node was properly installed by opening the Command Prompt on Windows (type `[Windows key]`, `cmd`, and `[Enter]`), or the Terminal Application on Mac or Linux, and then typing `node --version[Enter]`. If a version number comes up on the screen, you are good.
