# Why JavaScript
---
We will use a real world programming language for this course. I know I said the programming logic is the most important thing, we will use pseudocode, and yadda, yadda, yadda. But let's be honest, writing a bunch os pseudocode exercises without ever running a program 
is pretty boring. You want to see the practical results of your brain exercises. And I think it is useful to learn some programming 
logic concepts and apply them right away in translating your pseudocode into a computer program. This is precious practice.

If you want to practice your programming logic in a visual and entertaining way, you can also check out MIT's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a project developed at MIT to teach programming logic to children (and everyone else). It is pretty fun and
it is used worldwide to teach anyone interested in learning how to program.

Here we will use Javascript for a series of reasons:
1. It is a VERY popular language. Actually it is the most popular language in GitHub projects;
2.
